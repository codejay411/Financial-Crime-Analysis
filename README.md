# Financial-Crime-Analysis

Financial institutions around the world are turning to data science to combat crime and
manage compliance due to the changing nature of crime and a quickly expanding regulatory
landscape.

The global financial crisis of 2008 altered the course of history. It had an impact not only on
the financial industry, but also on other industries and enterprises around the world. The crisis
exposed ineffective policies that resulted in severe fractures that threatened to bring the
global financial system to its knees.

Technological advancements, and new capabilities to understand enormous volumes of data
can help to analyze and formulate the best approach to identify flaws and appropriate
interventions techniques to reduce financial crime.

AI, machine learning, and automation, among other advanced analytics and cognitive
techniques, can help to filter out false positives and improve inefficiencies in existing
investigation processes. Data and analytics have the potential to not only improve efficiencies
and save operating costs, but also help identify intelligence-led and data-driven approaches to
combating financial crime.
